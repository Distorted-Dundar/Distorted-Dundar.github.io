                        <h3>A mesmerizing spiral</h3>
                        <p>I took some inspiration, from a design in the book "Math Art: Truth, Beauty, and Equations
                            " by Stephen Ornes, click the image to see the code and animation!</p>

                        <h3>A Forest</h3>
                        <p>I was in awe when I first realized that trees were recursive definitions to draw. With help
                            by the
                            YouTube channel (The Coding Train) I was able to draw this tree that reminds me of my
                            favorite
                            plant-Cherry Trees-If another is drawn as a reflection it resembles a brain. Click the image

                        <p>Very similar to the previous piece if we change the angle of the branches they result in
                            exciting and
                            weird behavior the previous tree used a 45 degree angle to bloom, while this one uses 45 and
                            255 degrees

                        <h3>A simple pattern</h3>
                        <p>During my break I looked at the floor and noticed an interesting pattern. In the concrete I
                            saw there was
                            a hexagon pattern that locked with eachother so nicely and neatley that I wanted to give a
                            go to recreate
                            the pattern in code. Click the image to see the code.</p>

                        <h3>Fibonacci Circles </h3>
                        <p>I wanted to show beginning computer science students the beauty of recursion. After searching
                            For
                            captivating images on Google I came across this diagram, I was determined to figure out the
                            algorithim
                            which was clearly recusive. After many hours and frustration I was able to explain how the
                            algorithim
                            worked. The radius of each circle is proportionate to a fibonacci number. This is why its so
                            beatiful to
                            look at</p>

                            This peices repeats a sqaure pattern and then displaces to have that

                        <p>
                            This piece uses java via the processing framework.
                            You can click and drag to drop "sand" that repeats a certain
                            pastel pattern. You have to follow instructions in the gist (on image click) to run the code
                            for yourself
